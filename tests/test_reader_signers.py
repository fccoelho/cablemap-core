    (u'SPIERS', u'''4. THE POSSIBILITY OF ARMED ACTION NEAR THE IRAQI BORDER ALSO RAISED THE QUESTION OF IRAQI RESPONSE.  SO FAR THE GOT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT GAME IRAQ WAS PLAYING VIS-A-VIS IRAN.  ON THE ONE HAND INSTABILITY IN THE REGION WAS AS UNHELPFUL TO IRAQ AS IT WAS TO ANYONE ELSE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE WERE SUFFICIENT POINTS OF FRICTION BETWEEN A REVOLUTIONARY IRAN AND IRAQ THAT THE LATTER MIGHT WELL WISH TO STRENGTHEN ANTI-KHOMEINI FORCES.

5. REGARDING TIES BETWEEN IRANIAN KURDS AND OUTSIDE COUNTRIES, KOKSAL SAID THAT THERE WERE MANY REPORTS, BUT NOT MUCH HARD EVIDENCE, OF FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT WITH THE IRANIAN KURDS.  HE ASSUMED THAT OUTSIDE POWERS NOTWITHSTANDING PREDICTABLE DENIALS WOULD FEEL STRONG URGE TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN KURDISH ACTIVITIES.  REGARDING LINKS BETWEEN TURKISH AND IRANIAN KURDS, KOKSAL EMPHASIZED THAT RECENT PRESS REPORTS THAT TURKISH KURDS WERE PROVIDING LARGE-SCALE ASSISTANCE WERE TOTAL JOURNALISTIC FABRICATIONS.  TO DATE, GOT DID NOT HAVE IMPRESSION THAT THERE WAS ANY SUBSTANTIAL LINKAGE ALTHOUGH, OBVIOUSLY, WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE KURDS IN IRAN WOULD HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON ATTITUDES OF TURKISH KURDS.

6. BECAUSE OF THIS, AS WELL AS IN THE INTEREST OF REGIONAL STABILITY, TURKEY\'S OVERRIDING CONCERN WAS THAT IRAN MAINTAIN ITS TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND HAVE A STRONG AND EFFECTIVE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  FOR THIS REASON THE GOT HAD NOTED WITH INTEREST AND APPROVAL CHARGE LAINGEN\'S RECENT STATEMENT AFFIRMING US SUPPORT FOR IRAN\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY.

3. VINOGRADOV HAS SEEN KHOMEINI FOUR TIMES. HE DESCRIBED THE AYATOLLAH AS A MAN OF GREAT RECTITUDE, A TEACHER DISINCLINED TO LISTEN AND LITTLE VERSED IN POLITICAL REALITIES DOMESTICALLY OR INTERNATIONALLY.

4. THE SOVIETS THINK THE PGOI\'S MOST DANGEROUS PROBLEM IS THE KURDISH REVOLT, FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY THE STAGNATED ECONOMY. VINOGRADOV FEELS THE IRANIANS ARE TRYING TO MANAGE THE KURDS WITH FORCE AND THE ECONOMY WITH DREAMY ISLAMIC THEORIES.  NEITHER WILL WORK.  ALTHOUGH THE KURDISH PROBLEM MAY EVENTUALLY BE SETTLED, THERE WAS A REAL PROSPECT OF SHORTAGES, UNEMPLOYMENT AND OTHER SERIOUS ECONOMIC GRIEVANCES LEADING TO DISAFFECTION OF THE LOWER CLASSES FROM KHOMEINI.  IT HAS ALREADY STARTED, BUT THE PROCESS COULD CONTINUE FOR A COUPLE YEARS.
